 <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>


        <p>Effective date: June 29, 2019</p>
        
        <p>ThanksMister LLC ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Local Markets mobile application and website ("Service").</p>
        <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
        <p>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <h2>Accounts</h2>
        
        <p>When you sign up for Local Markets, we do not ask for any personal information – no username, no password, no email address. Instead, a random account number is generated. This number is the only identifier a person needs in order to access our Service.</p>
        <p>Anyone at anytime can create as many numbered accounts as they wish on our website. An account can be used by multiple people or devices or by someone other than the person who initially generated it.</p>
        <p>A Local Markets' account is funded for a period of 1 month, a user must fund the account each month to maintain their account. If an account becomes unfunded for a period of 1 week, all data associated with that account is deleted.</p>
        
        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you. However, we strive to collect as little data as possible to protect your privacy.</p>
